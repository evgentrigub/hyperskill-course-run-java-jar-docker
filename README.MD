# Run Java JAR in Docker

Learn how to build and run Java applications inside Docker containers. This educational project will guide you through the process of containerizing Java applications using Docker.

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Hyperskill platform and focuses on teaching practical skills for working with Java applications in Docker containers. Through a series of progressive stages, you'll learn everything from basic Docker concepts to advanced container management techniques.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding Docker basics and container concepts
- Creating Docker images for Java applications
- Managing the container lifecycle
- Running JAR files in Docker containers
- Best practices for Java containerization
- Working with Docker commands from Java code

## Project Structure

The project is divided into 5 progressive stages:

1. **Stage 1**: Introduction to Docker and basic setup
2. **Stage 2**: Creating and running Docker containers
3. **Stage 3**: Working with container management
4. **Stage 4**: Advanced container configuration
5. **Stage 5**: Production-ready containerization

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, make sure you have:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 21
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Basic understanding of Java programming
- Gradle build tool

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the prerequisites
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Run `./gradlew build` (or `gradlew.bat build` on Windows)

## How to Work on the Project

Each stage is contained in its own directory with:
- Source code templates
- Tests to verify your implementation
- Detailed task descriptions

Complete the stages sequentially, as each builds upon the knowledge from previous ones.

## Testing Your Solution

To test your implementation:

```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Build System

The project uses Gradle for:
- Dependency management
- Building the application
- Running tests
- Managing project configuration
